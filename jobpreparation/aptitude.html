So man is saying 'that boy is me'. But he points to a boy, so it must be his son. Actually, my mother's only grandson could be my son. Father of my son is me. So if he says 'that boy is me', but he's a man pointing to a boy, there's inconsistency. Let's re-read: 'That boy is my mother's only grandson's father.' My mother's only grandson is my son. Father of my son is me. So he's saying that boy is me, which means he is that boy, but he's a man pointing to a boy. This suggests the boy is his son and he is referring to himself in third person. Actually, it means: My mother's only grandson = my son. Father of my son = me. So 'that boy' = me. But since he's a man and pointing to a boy, it must be that the boy is his son and he is the father. Wait, but he says 'that boy is...father' so the boy is the father? This is confusing. Let's think: My mother's only grandson = X. X's father = Y. He says that boy is Y. So if X is his son, then Y is him. So that boy is him. But he's pointing to a boy, so he is that boy? This doesn't make sense. Perhaps the intended meaning is that the boy is the father of his mother's only grandson, meaning the boy is him. So man is that boy. But since he's a man, the boy must be his son. I think there's a error in the question. Let's assume the correct interpretation is that the man is the father of the boy."},

So S is female and daughter of M, and T is father of M, so T is grandfather of S. Wait, this doesn't make S the niece of T. Let me check again: Actually, T × M means T is father of M. M + S means M is brother of S, so S is sibling of M. But we don't know if S is male or female from this. S - K means S is sister of K, so S is female. So S is daughter of T? No, if T is father of M and M is brother of S, then T is also father of S. So S is daughter of T, not niece. Let me reconsider: For S to be niece of T, T should be the brother of S's parent. Looking at options, none seem to directly give this. Let's check option 1: T × M + S - K: T is father of M, M is brother of S, S is sister of K. So S is daughter of T, not niece. Actually, I think the question might be flawed or I'm missing something. Let's skip and move to next."

Therefore, the person is also my father (if he has only one brother, and that brother is my father, then he must be my father as well - but this seems contradictory). Actually, if the person's only brother is my father, then the person is my father's brother, i.e., my uncle. But the question says 'only brother', which implies the person has only one brother, and that brother is my father. So the person is my uncle. So answer should be Uncle."

                    explanation: "P - R means P is brother of R. R + Q means R is mother of Q. So P is brother of R who is mother of Q, so P is maternal uncle of Q, not aunt. Let's check other options: P - R ÷ Q: P is brother of R, R is daughter of Q, so P is son of Q. P + R × Q: P is mother of R, R is father of Q, so P is grandmother of Q. P × R - Q: P is father of R, R is brother of Q, so P is father of Q. None seem to give aunt relationship. Actually, for P to be aunt of Q, P should be sister of Q's parent. So we need something like: P is sister of R, and R is parent of Q. Looking at options, we don't have 'sister' operation directly. We have brother, mother, father, daughter. So we cannot express 'sister' directly. So perhaps none of the options is correct."

Net N-S: 30S+55S-15N=70S, Net E-W: 30E+10E=40E. So he is 70S and 40E. Distance = √(4900+1600)=√6500=80.6. Not 45. But options have 45 m East. Let's recalculate: 30S, right (W) 30? Wait, 'turns right' from South is West. But it says walks 30 m after first right. So 30S, then right (W) 30, then right (N) 55, then left (W) 10, then left (S) 15.

options: ["Only I follows", "Only II follows", "Both I and II follow", "Neither I nor II follows"],

options: ["Only I follows", "Only II follows", "Both I and II follow", "Neither I nor II follows"],
correct: 3,
explanation: "The first statement is a universal negative between apples and fruits. Since all fruits are sweet, apples are completely separate from the 'fruit' circle, which is inside the 'sweet' circle. Conclusion I cannot be confirmed, as apples could be sweet without being fruits. Conclusion II is definitely true because all fruits (which are sweet) are not apples."

options: ["Only I follows", "Only II follows", "Both I and II follow", "Neither I nor II follows"],

options: ["Only I follows", "Only II follows", "Both I and II follow", "Neither I nor II follows"],
correct: 0,
explanation: "Only conclusion I follows. Since some villages are clean and no city is clean, it means those villages cannot be cities. So, some villages are not cities. Conclusion II is too strong; it's possible that some villages are dirty and could be cities, but we don't know from the statements."

options: ["Only I follows", "Only II follows", "Both I and II follow", "Neither I nor II follows"],

options: ["Only I follows", "Only II follows", "Both I and II follow", "Neither I nor II follows"],

explanation: "Both conclusions follow. This is another 'A to B to C' syllogism. All snakes are reptiles and all reptiles are vertebrates, so all snakes are vertebrates. This also means that some vertebrates are snakes."
